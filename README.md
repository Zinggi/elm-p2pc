# Peer to Peer Chess

This is a project that was created on a "hackday".
The version here has been cleaned up a bit since the hackday.

## Credits

The chess game itself is implemented in [romstad/elm-chess](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/romstad/elm-chess/latest/), thanks!
To make WebRTC easier, I've used [simple-peer](https://github.com/feross/simple-peer), thanks!
For an earlier version I've used [peerJS](https://peerjs.com/).
